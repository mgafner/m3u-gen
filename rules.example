# i am using the identifier "tag" as same as "playlist"
# my playlists are generated out of "tags" which i am writing in the 
# comment-field of mp3-files. For example:
# comment: Rock; Pop; Schlager; 

# for each playlist btw comment-field we can declare a [section]
# each section may have optional settings:
# exclude_tags
# exclude_ratings
# exclude_artists
# include_tags
# include_ratings
# include_artists

# m3u-gen works recursive on every file in a given directory
# the working order of given settings is as seen in the settings list above.
# first we can exclude songs, then we can include some again

# future versions will have
# general settings given in (sections) with "(" and ")"
# special playlists given in {sections] with "{" and "}"
